This is a password generator. It creates a password based on criteria obtained from user input. You can choose if you would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You also have control over how man characters the password will be in length. 

In order to run the code, you can either visit the Github Pages URL for this repo, or download the files and open index.html in the browser of your choice. Pressing the generate button will prompt the user for responses which will determine the criteria for password generation.
